# AI for Health

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI for Health is a virtual health assistant that uses AI to provide personalized health recommendations and support, empowering users to improve their well being and achieve their health goals effectively and easy. 


## Background

AI for Health addresses the challenge of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in todays fast paced world by offering personalized health guidance and support. 

This problem is common globally due to:
* busy schedules 
* lack of access to personalized health information 
* difficulty of sticking to traditional healthcare plans. 

My personal motivation comes from a desire to leverage technology to improve healthcare accessibility and empower individuals to take proactive control of their health. 

This topic is important as it directly impacts individuals:
* overall well being
* productivity
* longevity

Making it both relevant and significant in todays society.


## How is it used?

Users interact with AI for Health through a mobile app or web platform, accessing personalized health recommendations and support at their convenience. The solution is needed in situations where individuals seek guidance to improve their health and wellness, such as managing chronic conditions, setting health goals or adopting healthier lifestyle habits. Users range from individuals with specific health concerns to those simply looking to maintain or improve their overall well being. Needs to consider include diverse health goals, dietary preferences, activity levels and accessibility preferences.
