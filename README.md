# AI for Health

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI for Health is a virtual health assistant that uses AI to provide personalized health recommendations and support, empowering users to improve their well being and achieve their health goals effectively and easy. 


## Background

AI for Health addresses the challenge of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in todays fast paced world by offering personalized health guidance and support. 

This problem is common globally due to:
* busy schedules 
* lack of access to personalized health information 
* difficulty of sticking to traditional healthcare plans. 

My personal motivation comes from a desire to leverage technology to improve healthcare accessibility and empower individuals to take proactive control of their health. 

This topic is important as it directly impacts individuals:
* overall well being
* productivity
* longevity

Making it both relevant and significant in todays society.


## How is it used?

Users interact with AI for Health through a mobile app or web platform, accessing personalized health recommendations and support at their convenience. The solution is needed in situations where individuals seek guidance to improve their health and wellness, such as managing chronic conditions, setting health goals or adopting healthier lifestyle habits. Users range from individuals with specific health concerns to those simply looking to maintain or improve their overall well being. Needs to consider include diverse health goals, dietary preferences, activity levels and accessibility preferences.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![image](https://github.com/FirAk333/my-new-project/assets/166814179/8d6b06ec-e27e-4743-b083-ea78a289fc01)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
