# AI for Health

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI for Health is a virtual health assistant that uses AI to provide personalized health recommendations and support, empowering users to improve their well being and achieve their health goals effectively and easy. 


## Background

AI for Health addresses the challenge of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in todays fast paced world by offering personalized health guidance and support. 

This problem is common globally due to:
* busy schedules 
* lack of access to personalized health information 
* difficulty of sticking to traditional healthcare plans. 

My personal motivation comes from a desire to leverage technology to improve healthcare accessibility and empower individuals to take proactive control of their health. 

This topic is important as it directly impacts individuals:
* overall well being
* productivity
* longevity

Making it both relevant and significant in todays society.


## How is it used?

Users interact with AI for Health through a mobile app or web platform, accessing personalized health recommendations and support at their convenience. The solution is needed in situations where individuals seek guidance to improve their health and wellness, such as managing chronic conditions, setting health goals or adopting healthier lifestyle habits. Users range from individuals with specific health concerns to those simply looking to maintain or improve their overall well being. Needs to consider include diverse health goals, dietary preferences, activity levels and accessibility preferences.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data for AI for comes from various sources, including user input like health goals, dietary preferences and activity levels. Data also comes from medical databases, wearable devices and health related articles and research papers. Some data may be collected directly by the project team while others may be sourced from third party providers or publicly available datasets ensuring a comprehensive and accurate representation of health information.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

AI for Health does not solve medical emergencies or replace professional medical advice or diagnosis. It also may not address complex health issues requiring specialized medical treatment. Limitations include potential inaccuracies in AI driven recommendations, privacy concerns related to handling sensitive health data and the risk of over reliance on technology for health management. Ethical considerations include ensuring user consent and data privacy, minimizing bias in AI algorithms and transparently communicating the limitations of the solution to users. Additionally equitable access to the solution and addressing potential disparities in healthcare access should be prioritized.

## What next?

This project has the potential to grow by expanding its capabilities to include predictive analytics for early disease detection, integration with electronic health records for seamless information sharing with healthcare providers and partnerships with fitness and wellness organizations to offer holistic health solutions. To move forward additional skills in machine learning, data analytics, software development and healthcare domain expertise would be beneficial. Collaboration with medical professionals, researchers and industry experts would also be essential to ensure the accuracy, effectiveness and ethical implementation of the solution. Funding and support from stakeholders like healthcare organizations, investors and government agencies would be necessary to scale the project and reach a wider audience.
